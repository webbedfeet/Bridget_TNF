1. Run binary models for 24 week outcomes
1. TJC is not available in YODA, so for external validation purposes, need to investigate the potential of BASDAI3 as a surrogate for TJC
1. Develop a non-responder model, i.e. look at no response.
    + develop at 12 weeks
    + See if it extends well to 24 weeks
    + Also develop 24 week model
